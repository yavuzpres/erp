Sale Order Archive
==================

On a system with a high volume of sales, the number of sale orders displayed
in the list view can become huge. This module allows to archive
Sale Orders that are in status Locked or Cancelled.

If a sale order is archived, it will be hidden from the sale orders list view.

This module is developed by the `KitWorks <https://kitworks.systems/>`__.
